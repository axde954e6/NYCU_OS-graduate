# Fast File Duplication (Operating systems)
### Objectives
* Understand the overheads involved in file
operations<br>
* Exploit kernel primitives to avoid (or to reduce)
these overheads<br>
### Goal
* Duplicate the file correctly and considerably improve upon Baseline<br>
### report
* Section 1: Analysis of Baseline
* Section 2: Proposed method
* Section 3: Performance evaluation
